# SeeSharpIndexer - C# Codebase Indexer for AI

## Project Overview
Create a modern WPF application that scans C# files and generates a compressed, token-efficient index suitable for AI consumption.

## Goals
- Analyze C# codebases and extract structural information
- Generate compact JSON index containing files, classes, methods, and properties
- Provide a sleek, dark-mode UI with modern controls
- Ensure high performance even with large codebases
- Create a usable tool that helps AIs understand large codebases efficiently

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- Create WPF solution with appropriate structure
- Set up necessary dependencies (JSON libraries, C# parsing)
- Configure basic app theme and styling

### 2. Core Functionality
- Implement C# file parser using Roslyn
- Design index format with optimal token efficiency
- Develop JSON compression functionality
- Create file/folder selection mechanism

### 3. UI Implementation
- Design modern dark-mode interface
- Implement file/folder import dialog
- Create file list with checkboxes for inclusion/exclusion
- Add buttons for adding/removing files
- Develop settings panel for configuration options
- Implement progress indicators for scanning operations

### 4. Advanced Features
- Add support for scanning entire directories recursively
- Implement filtering options for member visibility (public, private, etc.)
- Add options to customize index format and content
- Create preview functionality for generated index

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Optimize parsing for large codebases
- Implement background processing
- Add caching mechanisms for faster subsequent scans

### 6. Finalization
- Add error handling and user feedback
- Perform thorough testing with various codebases
- Create documentation
